**linopy** is an open-source python package that facilitates **optimization** with **real world data**. It builds a bridge between data analysis packages like [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) & [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and problem solvers like [cbc](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc), [gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (see the full list below). **Linopy** supports **Linear, Integer, Mixed-Integer and Quadratic Programming** while aiming to make linear programming in Python easy, highly-flexible and performant.



## Benchmarks

**linopy** is designed to be fast and efficient. The following benchmark compares the performance of **linopy** with the alternative popular optimization packages.

## Main features

**linopy** is heavily based on [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) which allows for many flexible data-handling features:

* Define (arrays of) continuous or binary variables with **coordinates**, e.g. time, consumers, etc.
* Apply **arithmetic operations** on the variables like adding, substracting, multiplying with all the  **broadcasting** potentials of xarray
* Apply **arithmetic operations** on the **linear expressions** (combination of variables)
* **Group terms** of a linear expression by coordinates
* Get insight into the **clear and transparent data model**
* **Modify** and **delete** assigned variables and constraints on the fly
* Use **lazy operations** for large linear programs  with [dask](https://dask.org/)
* Choose from **different commercial and non-commercial solvers**
* Fast **import and export** a linear model using xarray's netcdf IO


## Installation

So far **linopy** is available on the PyPI repository

```bash
pip install linopy
```

or on conda-forge

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge linopy
```

## In a Nutshell

Linopy aims to make optimization programs transparent and flexible. To illustrate its usage, let's consider a scenario where we aim to minimize the cost of buying apples and bananas over a week, subject to daily and weekly vitamin intake constraints.


```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import linopy

>>> m = linopy.Model()

>>> days = pd.Index(['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'], name='day')
>>> apples = m.add_variables(lower=0, name='apples', coords=[days])
>>> bananas = m.add_variables(lower=0, name='bananas', coords=[days])
>>> apples
```
```
Variable (day: 5)
-----------------
[Mon]: apples[Mon] ∈ [0, inf]
[Tue]: apples[Tue] ∈ [0, inf]
[Wed]: apples[Wed] ∈ [0, inf]
[Thu]: apples[Thu] ∈ [0, inf]
[Fri]: apples[Fri] ∈ [0, inf]
```

Add daily vitamin constraints

```python
>>> m.add_constraints(3 * apples + 2 * bananas >= 8, name='daily_vitamins')
```
```
Constraint `daily_vitamins` (day: 5):
-------------------------------------
[Mon]: +3 apples[Mon] + 2 bananas[Mon] ≥ 8
[Tue]: +3 apples[Tue] + 2 bananas[Tue] ≥ 8
[Wed]: +3 apples[Wed] + 2 bananas[Wed] ≥ 8
[Thu]: +3 apples[Thu] + 2 bananas[Thu] ≥ 8
[Fri]: +3 apples[Fri] + 2 bananas[Fri] ≥ 8
```

Add weekly vitamin constraint

```python
>>> m.add_constraints((3 * apples + 2 * bananas).sum() >= 50, name='weekly_vitamins')
```
```
Constraint `weekly_vitamins`
----------------------------
+3 apples[Mon] + 2 bananas[Mon] + 3 apples[Tue] ... +2 bananas[Thu] + 3 apples[Fri] + 2 bananas[Fri] ≥ 50
```

Define the prices of apples and bananas and the objective function

```python
>>> apple_price = [1, 1.5, 1, 2, 1]
>>> banana_price = [1, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5]
>>> m.objective = apple_price * apples + banana_price * bananas
```

Finally, we can solve the problem and get the optimal solution:

```python
>>> m.solve()
>>> m.objective.value
```
```
17.166
```

... and display the solution as a pandas DataFrame
```python
>>> m.solution.to_pandas()
```
```
        apples  bananas
day
Mon    2.667      0
Tue    0          4
Wed    0          9
Thu    0          4
Fri    0          4
```
