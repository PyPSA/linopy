    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Transport Problem is to select the quantities of a homogeneous good that has several production plants and several punctiform markets as to minimise the transportation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the default tutorial for the GAMS language, and GAMS equivalent code is inserted as single-dash comments. The original GAMS code needs slighly different ordering of the commands and it's available at http://www.gams.com/mccarl/trnsport.gms. The Pyomo version of the tutorial can be found at https://nbviewer.org/github/Pyomo/PyomoGallery/blob/master/transport/transport.ipynb. \n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, the variable names have been kept the same, though they are not pythonic. The equivalent GAMS code is included at the top of each cell as comments, while the Pyomo-equivalent is stated as text comments below.\n",

While this object contains variables, constraints, expressions, and the objective function as attributes, it does not currently contain fixed data like sets and parameters. Thus, they have been defined separately. Since linopy is built heavily on xarray's data structure, using xarray for that is convenient.\n",
