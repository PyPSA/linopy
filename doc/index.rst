linopy: Linear optimization with N-D labeled variables
======================================================

|PyPI| |CI| |License|


Welcome to Linopy! This Python library is designed to make linear programming easy, flexible, and performant. Whether you're dealing with Linear, Integer, Mixed-Integer, or Quadratic Programming, Linopy is as a user-friendly interface to define variables and constraints. It serves as a bridge, connecting data analysis packages such like
`xarray <https://github.com/pydata/xarray>`__ &
`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ with problem solvers.


Main features
-------------

**linopy** is heavily based on
`xarray <https://github.com/pydata/xarray>`__ which allows for many
flexible data-handling features:

-  Define (arrays of) contnuous or binary variables with
   **coordinates**, e.g. time, consumers, etc.
-  Apply **arithmetic operations** on the variables like adding,
   subtracting, multiplying with all the **broadcasting** potentials of
   xarray
-  Apply **arithmetic operations** on the **linear expressions**
   (combination of variables)
-  **Group terms** of a linear expression by coordinates
-  Get insight into the **clear and transparent data model**
-  **Modify** and **delete** assigned variables and constraints on the
   fly
-  Use **lazy operations** for large linear programs with
   `dask <https://dask.org/>`__
-  Choose from **different commercial and non-commercial solvers**
-  Fast **import and export** a linear model using xarray’s netcdf IO
-  Support of various solvers
   - `Cbc <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`__
   - `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`__
   - `HiGHS <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/hall/HiGHS/>`__
   - `MindOpt <https://solver.damo.alibaba.com/doc/en/html/index.html>`__
   - `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`__
   - `Xpress <https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-solver>`__
   - `Cplex <https://www.ibm.com/de-de/analytics/cplex-optimizer>`__
   - `MOSEK <https://www.mosek.com/>`__
   - `COPT <https://www.shanshu.ai/copt>`__
